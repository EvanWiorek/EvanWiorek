            <p>But I'm here because I love coding, too! I am:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Full-Stack Web Developer in progress</li>
                <li>Currently going through Coding Dojo</li>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I’ve worked with many different mediums, and I really love to learn. It is so rewarding to try something new and have it turn out well -  and even when it doesn’t, I can at least say that I’ve tried it!</p>

<p>I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, with a bachelors of science degree in Education.</p>

<p>When I am not working on projects, I am thanking God for everything He has given me, living life with my wife and kids, and/or playing video games 🖥️🎮.</p>
