# Hi - I'm Evan :)

            <p> I have a lot of hobbies. I like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Graphic Design</li>
                    <li>Video Production</li>
                    <li>Photography</li>
                    <li>Sewwing and Leathercraft</li>
                    <li>3D Printing and Painting</li>
                    <li>Drawing</li>
                </ul>
<p>But I'm here because I like coding, too! I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in progress, currently going through Coding Dojo. I am looking to find a job in front-end web. dev. where I can showcase my creative side, but am capable and enjoy working with back-end just as much.</p>
           
<p>I’ve worked with many different mediums, and I really love to learn. It is so rewarding to try something new and have it turn out well -  and even when it doesn’t, I can at least say that I’ve tried it!</p>

<p>I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, with a bachelors of arts degree in Family and Consumer Sciences Education, as well as a minor in Health Education. </p>

<p>When I am not working on projects, I am thanking God for everything He has given me, spending time with my wife and kids, and/or playing video games 🖥️🎮.</p>
